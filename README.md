🚀 AI Civic Issue Reporting System

An AI-powered platform that simplifies and accelerates the reporting of urban civic issues using a single image.

🏙️ Problem Statement

Urban civic issues such as potholes, garbage overflow, and broken streetlights often remain unresolved due to slow, manual, and inefficient reporting systems. Citizens are required to fill lengthy forms, provide detailed descriptions, and follow complex procedures—leading to delays and low engagement.

💡 Solution

AI Civic Issue Reporting System enables citizens to report civic problems instantly by uploading just one image. The system automatically detects the issue, assigns severity and priority, captures location, and generates a formal complaint—making civic reporting fast, simple, and structured.
